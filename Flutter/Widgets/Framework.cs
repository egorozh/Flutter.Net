/// A key that is unique across the entire app.
///
/// Global keys uniquely identify elements. Global keys provide access to other
/// objects that are associated with those elements, such as [BuildContext].
/// For [StatefulWidget]s, global keys also provide access to [State].
///
/// Widgets that have global keys reparent their subtrees when they are moved
/// from one location in the tree to another location in the tree. In order to
/// reparent its subtree, a widget must arrive at its new location in the tree
/// in the same animation frame in which it was removed from its old location in
/// the tree.
///
/// Reparenting an [Element] using a global key is relatively expensive, as
/// this operation will trigger a call to [State.deactivate] on the associated
/// [State] and all of its descendants; then force all widgets that depends
/// on an [InheritedWidget] to rebuild.
///
/// If you don't need any of the features listed above, consider using a [Key],
/// [ValueKey], [ObjectKey], or [UniqueKey] instead.
///
/// You cannot simultaneously include two widgets in the tree with the same
/// global key. Attempting to do so will assert at runtime.
///
/// ## Pitfalls
///
/// GlobalKeys should not be re-created on every build. They should usually be
/// long-lived objects owned by a [State] object, for example.
///
/// Creating a new GlobalKey on every build will throw away the state of the
/// subtree associated with the old key and create a new fresh subtree for the
/// new key. Besides harming performance, this can also cause unexpected
/// behavior in widgets in the subtree. For example, a [GestureDetector] in the
/// subtree will be unable to track ongoing gestures since it will be recreated
/// on each build.
///
/// Instead, a good practice is to let a State object own the GlobalKey, and
/// instantiate it outside the build method, such as in [State.initState].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * The discussion at [Widget.key] for more information about how widgets use
/// keys.

# Sample Parity Matrix

Scope: structural parity of sample routes/modules between C# and Dart samples.

Last checked: 2026-03-11

Status legend:

- `done`: feature exists in both samples and is wired in route map/menu.
- `verify-runtime`: structural parity exists, but interactive behavior still needs runtime validation.
- `missing`: present only on one side.

## Route and Feature Parity

| Feature | C# sample | Dart sample | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App bootstrap | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/CounterApp.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/counter_app.dart` | done | Counter model + scope app root present on both sides. |

| Editable text demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/EditableTextDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/editable_text_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Includes baseline input flow plus multiline Notes demo (`Enter` newline, Up/Down caret travel), seed action, and escaped live value summary. |
| Proxy widgets demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/ProxyWidgetsDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/proxy_widgets_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates widget-level `Opacity`, `Transform`, and `ClipRect` composition with interactive controls. |
| Align demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/AlignDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/align_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates widget-level `Align` and `Center` with alignment positions and shrink-wrap factors. |
| Stack demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/StackDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/stack_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates widget-level `Stack` and `Positioned` overlay behavior with movable/pinned badge positioning. |
| DecoratedBox demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/DecoratedBoxDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/decorated_box_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates widget-level `DecoratedBox` with `BoxDecoration`, `BorderSide`, and `BorderRadius` controls. |
| Container demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/ContainerDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/container_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates `Container` composition with `alignment`, `margin`, `constraints`, and `transform` behavior (including clamp/tighten interaction). |
| AspectRatio + Spacer demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/AspectRatioDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/aspect_ratio_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates widget-level `AspectRatio` tight sizing and `Spacer` flex-gap behavior. |

| FittedBox demo | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/FittedBoxDemoPage.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/fitted_box_demo_page.dart` | verify-runtime | Demonstrates widget-level `BoxFit` scaling (`contain/cover/fill/none/scaleDown`) and alignment-controlled placement. |
| Shared counter widgets | `src/Sample/Flutter.Net/CounterWidgets.cs` | `dart_sample/lib/counter_widgets.dart` | verify-runtime | Includes keyed/movable/keep-alive helper widgets. |

## When Updating Sample Features

1. Update C# sample (`src/Sample/Flutter.Net/*`).
2. Apply equivalent Dart change (`dart_sample/lib/*`) in the same iteration.
3. Update this matrix status/notes.
4. Record shipped parity changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
